# IBM Natural Language Understanding Demo
This was a class project for my cloud developer foundations cert.  You can view it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://nlu.theliberry.com">Click</a>  It shows some of the capability of IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API.

To install it, clone the repo.  CD into the app directory.

```
cd *erver*
```
The above CDs into the backend and
```
cd *Client*
```
That CDs into the frontend

You need an API key that you get from IBM.

CD into the backend and save .env.example as .env and add the necessary environment variables. Then do:
```
npm i
```
CD into the frontend and do:
```
npm i
npm run build
```
Start the app in the backend by running
```
npm run start
```
It should output to port 8080 by default.
